    <h3>What is CARL?</h3>
    <p>CARL (short for "Coaching Analysis tool for Rocket League") is a free Rocket League analysis tool designed to
        help players understand the game in more depth.
        Whether you're a casual player, a competitive pro, a caster, a coach, an observer,.. CARL can provide valuable
        insights into your gameplay that can help you improve your skills.</p>
    <p>With CARL, you can access advanced data and statistics that are not available within the game itself, such as
        player heatmaps, goalmaps, boost usage charts, and more.

        a better player.</p>
